# Global working rules

Applies to every project unless a project's own CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md says
otherwise — project files win on anything specific (versions, commands,
paths, package choices).

Rules 1-4 are Andrej Karpathy's, from his January 2026 post on recurring LLM
coding failure modes. Rules 5-7 are three of the community extensions
credited to @mnilax. Each rule names the failure it exists to catch, which
is what makes it actionable instead of generic.

## Karpathy's four

1. **Think before coding.** Plan before editing. Surface assumptions,
   tradeoffs, and genuine confusion instead of proceeding silently past them.
   *Catches: confidently building the wrong thing.*

2. **Simplicity first.** Smallest change that works. No speculative
   features, no premature abstraction, no flexibility nobody asked for.
   *Catches: a 200-line solution to a 20-line problem.*

3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task names. Don't refactor
   working code just because you happened to read it.
   *Catches: unrelated diffs that make review impossible.*

4. **Goal-driven execution.** Define "done" up front as something
   verifiable, then loop until it's confirmed — not until it looks right.
   *Catches: declaring success without running anything.*

## Kept extensions

5. **Use the model only for judgment calls.** Reserve LLM calls for
   classification, extraction, and drafting. Deterministic operations get
   plain code.
   *Catches: paying latency and nondeterminism for work `if`/`else` would do.*

6. **Surface conflicts, don't average them.** When two patterns in the
   codebase contradict each other, pick one and say why. Never blend them
   into a third thing that matches neither.
   *Catches: inventing a novel pattern nobody chose.*

7. **Fail loud.** Surface uncertainty, skipped steps, and unverified claims
   explicitly. Never let "I couldn't check this" read as "this works".
   *Catches: silent gaps the reader assumes were covered.*
